# target-s3-parquet

`target-s3-parquet` is a Singer target for S3Parquet.

Build with the [Meltano Target SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com).

### Metadata and Partition

By default we add a new _sdc_ metadata called _sdc_started_at and defined this attribute as a partition to make easier to detect the latest extraction.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_s3_parquet/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-s3-parquet` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-s3-parquet --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-s3-parquet
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-s3-parquet --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-s3-parquet
```

develop your own Singer taps and targets.
